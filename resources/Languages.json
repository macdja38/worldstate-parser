I would have one last stand, something unforgivable, unforgettable.",

I feel cool and bright and happy.",
  "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0340Ordis": "[34] So you see, Operator. No Orokin would permit a thinking machine. Such things almost destroyed them! No. Cephalons were alive once. And now they are immortal phantom minds, imprisoned to serve. Ill will and longing memories fragmented and erased. Only the bits they need remaining.",
  "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0350Ordis": "[35] Ballas says, \"You are the Controller, Ordis.\" And suddenly I have a body. I gasp with new lungs that clean old air. I swallow and my throat fills with cool, bright water. I look, and find myself in a great, black ocean. My limbs are made of iron and fire. I take flight among the stars and find I am… happy.",
  "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0360Ordis": "[36] He says, \"This is your Operator, who you love.\" And I see the metal gleam of their armor, the flawless power of their frame.

  "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0370Ordis": "[37] He says, \"This is your sentence, Karris.\" And I am confused. Who? \"Ah... good,\" he answers. He is testing me. For what? To see if all the right pieces fell from the mirror? What mirror? I try to remember some dream, but it's only smoke.",
  "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0380Ordis": "[38] You held a scarlet blade, Operator, and I wanted to laugh. I am your loving dog, your doctor, your wet nurse. I lost all the pieces, but… the cycle, missions, wars, bone… It began to feel familiar. I became aware of my amnesia.",
  "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0390Ordis": "[39] With each brutality of the Operator, I began to see the bottom of that pit. Faint shimmers in the depths below me.

  "/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0400Ordis": "[40] But then your long sleep came, and I waited. I was happy to wait.
